Final Project: Voice Controlled Tic-Tac-Toe

Worked on final project with partner: Vincent Liu (vincentl)

Instructions on how to run code


Connect two Cozmos to separate machines along with microphones as well.
Do a runfsm for the CozmoA file on one Cozmo and then a runfsm with the CozmoB file
for the other Cozmo. 

Each Cozmo will then await instructions after mapping the board. 
The expression ('Cozmo Alpha (square) now') will instruct Cozmo to move
a chip to the corresponding square, where square is a placeholder for the animals
seen on the board.

Do the same actions for CozmoB but use Bravo instead.
